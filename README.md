# Jenkins GitOps Docker Repository

Welcome to the Jenkins GitOps Docker repository! This repository contains the Dockerfile, Jenkinsfile, and application code necessary for building and deploying a Flask application using Jenkins in a GitOps workflow.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find the following files:

- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for the Flask application.
- `Jenkinsfile`: Defines the Jenkins pipeline stages for building, testing, and pushing the Docker image.
- `app.py`: Contains the code for a simple Flask application.
- `requirements.txt`: Specifies the Python dependencies required by the Flask application.

## Getting Started

To get started with building and deploying the Flask application using Jenkins and Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Configure Jenkins:** Set up Jenkins to trigger pipelines based on changes to this repository. Ensure that Jenkins is installed and configured properly.

3. **Configure Docker Hub Credentials:** Add your Docker Hub credentials to Jenkins to allow pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub. Refer to Jenkins documentation for instructions on adding credentials.

4. **Update Jenkins Pipeline:** Customize the Jenkinsfile if necessary to match your Jenkins configuration and requirements.

5. **Commit Changes:** Once you've configured Jenkins and updated the pipeline, commit the changes to this repository.

6. **Monitor Build:** Jenkins will automatically detect changes in this repository and trigger pipeline jobs to build and push the Docker image. Monitor the pipeline execution and Docker image build status in Jenkins.
